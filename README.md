I developed this program for myself to memorize the painfully long GRE wordlists. Its unique feature is the way you can set up quizzes that will make sure you end up memorizing the words you tend to forget.

I must admit that this is one of the worse examples of my coding abilities :(. I developed it when I had about two weeks before my exams. So, you can guess, the code is pretty messy. I seriously plan to clean it up (some day).

More on this laterâ€¦
